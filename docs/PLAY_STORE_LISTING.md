DebugMaster is the fun, gamified way to learn debugging skills. Whether you're a computer science student, self-taught programmer, or developer looking to sharpen your skills, DebugMaster helps you practice finding and fixing bugs in real Java code.

🎯 WHAT DEBUGMASTER DOES

• Complete solution with detailed explanation
• XP rewards for completing challenges

No theory lectures or boring videos - just hands-on practice with immediate feedback.
